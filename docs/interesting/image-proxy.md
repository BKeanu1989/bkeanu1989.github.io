# Image proxy
Image proxy help to produce more adequate images for "every" user for example resizing it to the device screen.
I got to know of it because of Nuxt js. But we can use [ipx](https://github.com/unjs/ipx) with a simple express server.

## Features
most important features imo:
- change image format (webp, avif, etc)
- change sizes (height / width)
- quality

some other features:
- position
- blur
- sharpen
- rotate
